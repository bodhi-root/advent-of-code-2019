# Advent of Code 2019

I finally completed the [__Advent of Code__](https://adventofcode.com)!  I tried this last year, and the problems just drove me kind of nuts.  I finished 3 of them and then quit.  This year we had a healthy competition going with several people at work, and that was the motivation it took to finish all the puzzles.

Since this was so fun, I've uploaded my code to GitHub.  I used Java to solve every problem except problem 1 (which I solved in Excel - just for fun).  The code is containd in ```src``` and input files and problem descriptions in ```files```.

Now to be fair, I did have to lookup help with 2 problems:

* Day 16-B (trick for solving only the lower half of the FFT matrix)
* Day 22-B (trick for turning problem into inverse modular arithmetic problem)

While I might have figured 16-B out eventually, I'm damn sure I never would have figured out 22-B.  That one was crazy!

This year's problems were quite enjoyable.  They involved building an IntCode computer (which was complete by day 9) that could run programs and was used extensively in later problems.  We used this computer to explore mazes, play a game of asteroids, run a springdroid simulator, and even explore a space station an interactive text-based game.  While different people were given different inputs, I've saved mine in the ```files``` folder along with a ```README.md``` for each problem.  A few problems have some notes (mostly on problem 18, which I had the hardest time with).  For the others, the notes are in the code.

To view the problems on the Advent of Code site and to solve them yourself, head to:

It looks like you can even play past year's problems (all the way back to 2015!).  So I guess I have some more work to do!
